# `React` `+` `TailwindCSS` Template
#

- The main reason of making this is so that you don't have to install and configure your project
to work with `TailwindCSS` every single time.

# Future plans:
- Will be adding new components that should be in react, but are not there.
- If you've got any ideas as to what should be added, 
please let me know here on github, or on discord under `ancho1211`.


> Please run `npm install` or click here, after pulling this repo.
